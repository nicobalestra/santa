# santa

A very simple web app I've built for my company to allow people draw a secret santa match.

This super powerful web application relies on the following technology stack:

* Clojure
** Ring
** Compojure
** clj-http
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server-headless
